## TODO:

- [x] Form regex is broken
- [x] Ensure lowercase emails are consistent
- [x] Add space in with comma separation support (for batch email additions in admin panel)
- [ ] Test suite from start to finish
- [ ] Refactor all code and ensure proper function use and proper security
- [ ] Write pages

### Notes:

/src/lib/db.ts currently has support for phone numbers so if that is not allowed that will need to be changed.
